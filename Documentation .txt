## Introduction
This project is a web-based workflow system developed to capture customer information and visualize financial data in a graph using PHP, MySQL, and CanvasJS.

## Project Description

##SQL(setup the database and tables)

if it does not it will create a new database and tables
Before executing the localhost/Work-Flow-Sy

### User Input
The user enters customer details (first name, last name, and date of birth) using an HTML form and then click save button 
to store the values into database table.

### Upload File
An Excel file containing customer financial information is uploaded through the form after clicking the submit button.

### Process
After uploading the file, PhpSpreadsheet is used to process the data from the file into an SQL database where it will be stored
 in a table called customer_finance which has values(month, income and expenses) matching the ones from excel file.

### Display the Graph
The graph is displayed using a CanvasJS template, which visualizes the customer information that was uploaded from the excel file.

## Front-end
- **HTML:** Used to structure the form for user input and file upload.
- **CSS:** Used to style the form and adjust the size of the text.

## Backend
- **PHP:** Handles all the information submitted through the form utilizing the `$_REQUEST` and `$_POST` methods. Also used the PhpSpreadsheet library for processing the uploaded Excel file and storing the data in the database.
- **SQL:** Used to store customer information (first name, last name, and date of birth) and financial data (Month, Income, and Expenses) in MySQL via phpMyAdmin.
- **CanvasJS:** Used to display the graph with the provided template.
